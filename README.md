# Student Information Management System

## Project Overview
This Student Information Management System is a console-based C program designed to manage and store student data. It allows users to add, find, update, and delete student records. The system can handle up to 100 students and stores essential details such as names, roll numbers, CGPA, and registered courses.

## Features
- **Add Student**: Add a new student record, including first name, last name, roll number, CGPA, and courses.
- **Find Student by Roll Number**: Search for a student using their roll number.
- **Find Student by First Name**: Search for students by their first name.
- **Find Students by Course**: Find all students enrolled in a specific course.
- **Count Students**: Display the total number of students in the system.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student record by their roll number.
- **Update Student**: Update the details of an existing student by their roll number.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vedant-Gidra/student-information-system.git
    cd student-information-system
    ```

2. **Compile the Program**:
   - Using GCC:
     ```bash
     gcc -o student_management main.c
     ```
